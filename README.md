# Simulating Decision-Making Paradigms in the Macaque Auditory Cortex using The Virtual Brain: An Analysis of Cortical Column Dynamics and Stimulus-Driven Neural Activity


The objective of this manuscript is to simulate a decision-making paradigm in the macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) utilizing the computational framework of The Virtual Brain (TVB). This study builds upon the foundational work conducted by E. Baspinar and colleagues, adapting their existing model into the TVB platform.
To map out the neural network of the macaque, we have employed the openly accessible CoCoMac Connectivty dataset. This database facilitates the understanding of the intricate web of neuronal connections, providing an essential foundation for our simulation project.

Decision-making processes are known to heavily involve the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Therefore, our analysis primarily focuses on the response of the PFC to various input signals directed to A1. To streamline the complexity of our model, we have elected to focus on binary decision-making tasks. In the context of our simulation, the subject (represented by the model) is required to discern between two distinct stimuli with differing properties.
Each selection made by the subject constitutes a trial, while a series of trials are grouped together to form an episode. Notably, between each episode, we update a regulatory module as well as a reward mechanism. This iterative process is designed to emulate the natural adaptive responses within the brain during decision-making processes.

The outcomes of our study may shed light on the complex neural dynamics involved in decision-making processes, and how they may be influenced by various auditory stimuli. This understanding can be further extrapolated to explore potential therapeutic interventions for conditions affecting decision-making abilities.
